# üè† California Housing Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning. The project is hosted on a web application built with Streamlit, and the deployed website can be accessed [here](https://pujanpaudel-cal-housing.hf.space).

## üìä Notebooks

The project details and exploration are documented in Jupyter notebooks, located in the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder:

- **Data Preprocessing.ipynb:** This notebook covers the preprocessing steps for the California housing dataset.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb:** In this notebook, you'll find in-depth exploratory data analysis, including data frame visualizations, charts, and graphs to understand the characteristics of the California housing dataset.

- **Model.ipynb:** Here, the machine learning models are built and evaluated. It includes information on feature engineering, model selection, and performance metrics.

## üåê Web Application

The deployed web application allows users to interact with the model and explore housing predictions for different scenarios. Visit the hosted website [here](https://pujanpaudel-cal-housing.hf.space) for a hands-on experience.

For additional information, refer to the project description on the website.

Feel free to explore the notebooks for a comprehensive understanding of the project.
